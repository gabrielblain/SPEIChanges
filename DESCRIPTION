Description: Improves the interpretation of the Standardized Precipitation
    Evapotranspiration Index under changing climate conditions. The package uses
    a nonstationary approach to detect trends in the difference between
    precipitation and potential evapotranspiration rates and to
    quantify threi effect on the probability of a drought event
    occurring.
