\title{Aggregate daily precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (P - PE)
totals at quasi-week time scales}
\usage{
PPEaggreg(daily.PPE, start.date, TS = 4L)
}
\arguments{
\item{daily.PPE}{Numeric vector, 1-column matrix, or data frame with daily P - PE totals.}

\item{start.date}{Date at which the aggregation should start.
Accepts most common formats (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY/MM/DD").}

\item{TS}{Integer indicating the time scale on a quasi-week basis
(values between 1 and 96). Default is 4, representing a monthly scale.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with columns:
Year, Month, quasiWeek, and PPE.at.TS.
}
\description{
Aggregate daily precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration (P - PE)
totals at quasi-week time scales
}
\details{
This function divides each month into four fixed quasi-week periods:
days 1–7, 8–14, 15–21, and 22–end of month. This yields 48 quasi-week
intervals per year, independent of the aggregation scale.
When \code{TS = 4}, the function computes rolling sums of four consecutive
quasi-weekly totals, which aligns with the widely used one month time scale.

daily.PPE <- Campinas[, 11]
PPE_TS4 <- PPEaggreg(daily.PPE, start.date = "1995-01-01", TS = 4)
